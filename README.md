# 👩‍💻 Hi there! I'm Kelli Souza

💡 My passion for data began during an internship at the Municipal Historical Archive, where I discovered the importance of organising, interpreting, and transforming data into knowledge. Since then, I’ve immersed myself in both technical and analytical learning.

📌 Currently:
- I work with **exploratory data analysis** and build dashboards using **Power BI**, **Tableau**, and **Metabase**
- I use **SQL**, **Python**, and both relational and non-relational databases (SQL Server, MongoDB)
- I develop solutions to support strategic decision-making in business areas

🛠️ **Technologies & Tools**
- Languages: `SQL`, `Python`, `JavaScript`
- BI Tools: `Power BI`, `Tableau`, `Metabase`
- Databases: `SQL Server`, `MongoDB`

📚 **Education**
- Bachelor of Technology in Systems Analysis and Development – Impacta Tecnologia (2023–2025)
- Multiple complementary courses in Data Analytics, Python, SQL, Power BI, and Data Visualisation (Codecademy, Alura, EBAC, University of Michigan, among others)

🚀 **Featured Projects**
- [📊 Domestic Violence in Brazil - 2020](https://lnkd.in/dZ3i2v74): a comparative analysis using SINAN/SUS data and interactive visualisations.
> This project explores both the absolute volume and population-adjusted notification rates, offering a critical analytical view of a sensitive and important issue.

💬 **Favourite Quote**
> “Solving our greatest problems requires understanding both the human context and the software code, both ethics and statistics.”
